# Third-Party-APIs

In this activity, I had to create a Work Day Schedule planner: I had to practice writing jQuery, create a time-block table in HTML, reference a third party API (Moment.js), and finally place and retrieve user-data input into local storage. When building the 'Work Day Schedule' planner, I had use jQuery to connect to a third party API (Moment.js) to bring functionality to my planner: color-coordinating (green, red, grey) to the hour-block, as well as applying a value to each hour block.

# Problems & Solving

Initially, I had a lot of trouble getting started with what to write in jQuery. However, after writing pseudocode, it made it a lot easier for me to understand what I needed to accomplish in this activity. I also struggled with creating a function for the save button and storing data into local storage (*still haven't figured it out*).
